Remixing/Forking Instructions:
<br>
You can't just remix the Scratch project and it'll work out of the box. You have to fork the code here and then update the project id in the code to the id in the new project. You'll also need to change the session id and Google API key in the secrets menu (found in the github settings).
<br>
To get your Scratch session id go [here](https://github.com/TimMcCool/scratchattach/wiki/Get-your-session-id) and to get your Google API key (which you can make free or paid but I use free) go [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey). You might have to sign in.
<br>
The way I host this ChatGPT thing is using Github Actions, which is really bad but free. (if you have any suggestions for free hosting with secrets and variables please tell me).
<br>
Remember to change the code in the "main.py" function to whatever your current scratch project is.
